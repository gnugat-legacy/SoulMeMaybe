# SoulMeMaybe, an open source client for Netsoul

> Hey, I just met EPITECH,
> And this is crazy,
> But here's my NetSoul client,
> So soul me, maybe?

**SoulMeMaybe** is a simple client for NetSoul, a protocol used in EPITECH
university allowing its students to:

1. **use internet**;
2. **log their active presence**;
3. **localize each other**;
4. send messages to each other.

By simply sending ping requests, **SoulMeMaybe** only supports the three first
points and does not plan on doing more.
