**SoulMeMaybe** is a simple client for NetSoul, a protocol used in EPITECH
university allowing its students to:

1. **use internet**;
2. **log their active presence**;
3. localize each other;
4. instant message.

By simply sending ping requests, **SoulMeMaybe** only supports the two first
points and does not plan on doing more.
